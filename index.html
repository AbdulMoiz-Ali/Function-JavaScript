      <h1>-: Functions :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        A function is a block of JavaScript that robotically does the same thing
        again and again, <br />
        whenever you invoke its name. It saves you repetitive coding and makes
        your code easier to <br />
        understand. <br />
        On your website, suppose there are several pages where you want to
        display an alert that <br />
        tells the user the current time. (To keep it simple, we'll settle for
        24-hour time rather than <br />
        converting to a.m. and p.m.) The code might look like this. <br />
        1 var now = new Date(); <br />
        2 var theHr = now.getHours(); <br />
        3 var theMin = now.getMinutes(); <br />
        4 alert("time: " + theHr + ":" + theMin); <br />
        You could write this block of code over and over again, every time you
        need it. Or you <br />
        could write it once as a function, naming it, say, tellTime. After that,
        this is the only code <br />
        you'll need in order to make the whole block execute: <br />
        tellTime(); <br />
        Whenever JavaScript sees that short statement, the time-telling block
        executes. <br />
        This is how you package the one-off code above as a repeatable function:
        <br />
        1 function tellTime() { <br />
        2 var now = new Date(); <br />
        3 var theHr = now.getHours(); <br />
        4 var theMin = now.getMinutes(); <br />
        5 alert("Current time: "+ theHr + ":" + theMin); <br />
        6 } <br />
        The time-telling code—the code that creates the Date object, extracts
        the time, formats it, <br />
        and displays an alert—is exactly the same code we started with, but is
        now packaged as a <br />
        function. Here are the parts: <br />
        1. On line 1 an opening declaration statement that includes: <br />
        • the keyword function <br />
        • a name I made up for the function <br />
        • parentheses that identify it as a function <br />
        • an opening curly bracket to enclose the code that will execute <br />
        2. On lines 2 through 5 the same block of code that you saw before
        executes, but it's <br />
        indented for clarity. Opinions vary on how much to indent. I train you
        to indent 2 spaces. <br />
        3. On line 6 a closing curly bracket on its own line to enclose the code
        that will execute <br />
        Again, note that the calling code—the code that invokes the
        function—does nothing more <br />
        than state the name of the function including its parentheses. <br />
        tellTime(); <br />
        You can give a function any name that would be a legal variable name,
        then add <br />
        parentheses. Function-naming follows the same rules as variable naming
        because, technically, <br />
        a function is a variable. This will make more sense to you when you
        learn more about <br />
        functions in a subsequent chapter. <br />
        Functions and the statements that call them may be separated by
        thousands of lines of <br />
        code. Typically, functions are in the same place as the main code—in an
        external JavaScript <br />
        file, at the end of the HTML body section, or in the HTML head section.
        Normally, all the <br />
        functions should precede the main code, so when they're called by the
        main code, they're <br />
        already loaded in memory and ready to go. <br />

      <h1>-: Functions: Passing them data :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        A function is a block of code that does something robotically, whenever
        you invoke its <br />
        name. For example, when you write greetUser(); a function with that name
        executes. To be <br />
        clear: The kind of function I'm talking about is one that you've written
        yourself, and named <br />
        yourself. <br />
        Suppose that when you write greetUser(); a function is called that
        displays an alert <br />
        saying, "Hello, there." <br />
        This is the code for the function. <br />
        1 function greetUser() { <br />
        2 alert("Hello, there."); <br />
        3 } <br />
        One of the really useful things about functions is that those
        parentheses in the calling code <br />
        don't have to be empty. If you put some data inside the parentheses, you
        can pass that data to <br />
        the function that it'll use when it executes. <br />
        Suppose, instead of writing greetUser(); you write... <br />
        greetUser("Hello, there."); <br />
        Now, instead of just calling the function, you're calling it and passing
        data to it. The <br />
        string inside the parentheses, i.e. the data you're passing, is called
        an argument. <br />
        The function is now more versatile, because the message it displays is
        no longer hardwired into <br />
        it. It'll display any message that you pass to it from the calling code,
        via the <br />
        argument. <br />
        In order for a function to become a programmable robot rather than a
        one-job robot, you <br />
        have to set it up to receive the data you're passing. Here's how you do
        it. <br />
        1 function greetUser(greeting) { <br />
        2 alert(greeting); <br />
        3 } <br />
        So now we've filled the parentheses of both the calling code and the
        function definition. <br />
        The parentheses of the calling code contain an argument. In the example,
        the argument is the <br />
        string "Hello, there." And, as you can see in the example above, the
        parentheses of the function <br />
        definition now contain a variable, greeting. <br />
        A variable inside the parentheses in a function statement is known as a
        parameter. The <br />
        parameter name is up to you. You can give it any name that would be
        legal for a variable. Then <br />
        you can use it to accomplish something in the body of the function. On
        line 2 in the example <br />
        above, I used it to specify the message in an alert. <br />
        You don't have to declare a variable when it's used as a parameter in a
        function <br />
        definition. When it's used as a parameter, the declaration is implicit.
        <br />
        The argument in the statement that calls the function —"Hello,
        there."—is the data that's <br />
        passed to the function. The parameter inside the parentheses in the
        function definition catches <br />
        the data that's passed. It now holds "Hello, there." In other words, the
        string "Hello, there", <br />
        specified in the function call, is assigned to greeting in the function.
        Then that variable, <br />
        greeting, is used to specify the message in the alert statement. <br />
        The value passed to a function is used in the body of the function to
        accomplish <br />
        something. In this case, the value is used to specify the message in the
        alert. <br />
        In the example, the argument is a string, but it could just as easily be
        a variable. In the <br />
        following code, I declare the variable greeting and assign it the value
        "Hello, there." Then, <br />
        rather than using the string itself as an argument in the function call,
        I use the variable. <br />
        1 var greeting = "Hello, there." <br />
        2 greetUser(greeting); <br />
        In the example above, the name of the function greetUser, shares some of
        its name with <br />
        the parameter greeting, but that's just to make the code easy to
        understand. The name of the <br />
        function and the name of the parameter don't have to have anything in
        common. And remember, <br />
        these names are up to you, as long as you follow the variable-naming
        rules. <br />
        In the example, I named the argument in the calling code greeting, and
        also named the <br />
        parameter in the function code greeting. But this isn't necessary,
        either. They don't have to <br />
        match. No matter what an argument's name is, it is accepted by the
        parameter, no matter what <br />
        the parameter's name is. In the following code, the variable whatever is
        the argument. The <br />
        parameter greeting doesn't match the name, but still catches the value.
        <br />
        Here's the function, once again, with the parameter greeting. <br />
        1 function greetUser(greeting) { <br />
        2 alert(greeting); <br />
        3 } <br />
        And here's the statement that calls the function, with the argument
        whatever. <br />
        1 var whatever = "Hello, there."; <br />
        2 greetUser(whatever); <br />
        It's okay that the name of the argument and the name of the parameter
        don't match. The <br />
        parameter still catches the argument, the string "Hello, there." <br />
        Still, it often makes sense to give an argument and a parameter the same
        name, for clarity. <br />
        A number, either a literal number or a number represented by a variable,
        can be an <br />
        argument. In the following code I declare the variable almostAMil and
        assign the number <br />
        999999 to it. Then I use almostAMil as the argument in the function
        call. <br />
        1 var almostAMil = 999999; <br />
        2 showBigNum(almostAMil); <br />
        Alternatively, if I wanted to, I could use the literal number 999999 as
        the argument. <br />
        showBigNum(999999); <br />
        You can pass any number of arguments, separated by commas, to a
        function. Typically, <br />
        the function has the same number of parameters, also separated by
        commas. (There are rare <br />
        exceptions for special cases.) Again, when you use variables as
        arguments, their names don't <br />
        have to match the names of the parameters. JavaScript matches up
        arguments and parameters <br />
        according to their order, not their names. The first argument in the
        list is passed to the first <br />
        parameter in the list, the second argument is passed to the second
        parameter, and so on. <br />
        As arguments, you can use any combination of variables, strings, and
        literal numbers. In <br />
        the following example, the calling code passes a variable, a string, and
        a number to the <br />
        function. Three parameters catch the values. The function concatenates
        them to create an alert <br />
        message. <br />
        First, here's the function. <br />
        1 function showMessage(m, string, num); <br />
        2 alert(m + string + num); <br />
        3 } <br />
        Now here's the statement that calls the function. <br />
        1 var month = "March"; <br />
        2 showMessage(month, "'s winner number is ", 23); <br />
        The argument, month, a variable, is passed to the parameter m. The
        argument "'s winning <br />
        number is ", a string, is passed to the parameter string. The argument
        23, a literal number, is <br />
        passed to the parameter num. <br />
        When the code executes, an alert displays saying, "March's winning
        number is 23." <br />
        Normally, you'd use all the parameters included in the function
        definition as variables in <br />
        the code that executes, because, why else would you want them in the
        function definition? But <br />
        there's nothing that says you must use them all. And you certainly don't
        have to use them in the <br />
        same order in which they appear within the parentheses. Each one is a
        full-fledged variable <br />
        that, within the function, you can use the way you'd use any variable.
        <br />

      <h1>-: Functions: Passing data back from them :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        As you learned in the last chapter, a function becomes more versatile
        when you pass data <br />
        to it so it can deliver a custom job. <br />
        But a function can do even more. It can pass data back to the calling
        code. <br />
        Let's say you charge a minimum shipping rate of $5, plus 3 percent of
        the merchandise <br />
        total above $50, up to $100. You offer free shipping when the total hits
        $100. Here's the code <br />
        that calculates the order total. <br />
        1 var orderTot; <br />
        2 if (merchTot >= 100) { <br />
        3 orderTot = merchTot; <br />
        4 } <br />
        5 else if (merchTot < 50.01) { <br />
        6 orderTot = merchTot + 5; <br />
        7 } <br />
        8 else { <br />
        9 orderTot = merchTot + 5 + (.03 * (merchTot - 50)); <br />
        10 } <br />
        If the merchandise total is at least $100 (line 2), the order total is
        the same as the <br />
        merchandise total (line 3). If the merchandise total is $50 or less
        (line 5), the order total is the<br />
        merchandise total plus $5 (line 6). If the order total is between $50
        and $100 (line 8), the <br />
        order total is the merchandise total plus $5 plus 3 percent of the
        amount over $50 (line 9). <br />
        Something costing $150 is $150 total. <br />
        Something costing $15 is $20 total. <br />
        Something costing $70 is $75.60 total. <br />
        Here's how we turn the code above into a function. <br />
        1 function calcTot(merchTot) { <br />
        2 var orderTot; <br />
        3 if (merchTot >= 100) { <br />
        4 orderTot = merchTot; <br />
        5 } <br />
        6 else if (merchTot < 50.01) { <br />
        7 orderTot = merchTot + 5; <br />
        8 } <br />
        9 else { <br />
        10 orderTot = merchTot + 5 + (.03 * (merchTot - 50)); <br />
        11 } <br />
        12 return orderTot; <br />
        13 } <br />
        The thing to focus on here is that we declare a variable, orderTot (line
        2), and then— <br />
        here's what's new—after the processing is done and the merchandise total
        is known, the <br />
        function returns the value held in orderTot to the calling code (line
        12). It passes data back. <br />
        But then the calling code needs something to catch the data. What else
        could this <br />
        something be but a variable? Here's the code that calls the function.
        <br />
        var totalToCharge = calcTot(79.99); <br />
        If you're new to coding, this statement may look odd to you. How can a
        function be <br />
        assigned to a variable? You may be used to seeing a literal value
        assigned to a variable.... <br />
        var totalToCharge = 85.00; <br />
        You may be used to seeing a variable assigned to a variable... <br />
        var totalToCharge = merchTotal; <br />
        And you may be used to seeing an arithmetic or other expression assigned
        to a variable... <br />
        var totalToCharge = merchTotal + ship + tax; <br />
        But assigning a function to a variable? <br />
        Well, it's not really that odd, because, remember, what you're actually
        assigning to the <br />
        variable is the value passed back by the return statement in the
        function code. The <br />
        statement... <br />
        var totalToCharge = calcTot(79.99); <br />
        ...is shorthand for: "Assign to the variable totalToCharge the value
        returned by the <br />
        function calcTot." <br />
        So now there's two-way communication between the calling code and the
        function. The <br />
        calling code passes the value 79.99 to the function, which is caught by
        the function's parameter <br />
        merchTot. This variable, merchTot, is used in the body of the function
        to calculate an order <br />
        total. Then, through the return statement, that order total is passed
        back to totalToCharge in <br />
        the calling code. It's a complete circle. <br />
        Notice that the variable in the calling code, totalToCharge, that
        catches the value is <br />
        different from the variable inside the function, merchTot, that returns
        the value. I did this <br />
        purposely, so you wouldn't think the two variables have to share the
        same name. In the last <br />
        chapter you learned that when an argument in the calling code passes a
        value to a parameter in <br />
        the function definition, they can have the same name, but don't have to.
        The same applies to the <br />
        variable that's returned from a function and the variable in the calling
        code that catches it. They <br />
        can share the same name, but don't have to. <br />
        Anywhere you can use a variable, you can use a function. (Technically, a
        function is a <br />
        variable.) For example... <br />
        You can use a function to specify the message in an alert. <br />
        alert(calcTot(79.99)); <br />
        In the example above, the alert message is the value returned by the
        function calcTot <br />
        when the function is passed 79.99 as a parameter. <br />
        You can use a function in an expression. <br />
        var orderTot = merchTot + calcTax(merchTot); <br />
        In the example above, the value assigned to orderTot is the sum of
        merchTot and the <br />
        value returned by the function calcTax when the function is passed
        merchTot as an argument. <br />
        You can use a function in a function call. <br />
        var tot = calc(merchTot, calcTax(merchTot)); <br />
        In the example above, the calling code passes two arguments to the
        function calc. The <br />
        first argument is merchTot. The second argument is the function calcTax,
        which is also <br />
        passed merchTot. <br />
        Within a function, you can call another function. <br />
        1 function calcTot(price) { <br />
        2 return price + calcShip(price); <br />
        3 } <br />
        In the example above, the function calcTot calls the function calcShip.
        It passes price <br />
        as an argument and receives the shipping charge back. It adds the
        shipping charge to the price, <br />
        and returns the sum to the original calling code as a total. <br />
        You've learned that you can pass any number of arguments to any number
        of parameters. <br />
        Unfortunately, you don't have this flexibility in the return statement.
        No matter how many <br />
        parameters it takes or how much processing it does, a function can
        return only a single value to <br />
        the code that calls it. <br />

      <h1>-: Functions : Local vs. global variables :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        Now we come to the subject of variable scope. That is, the difference
        between global <br />
        and local variables. Some variables have global scope, which makes them
        global variables. <br />
        Other variables have local scope, which makes them local variables.
        Nothing could be <br />
        simpler, but for some reason, when the subject comes up in books and
        tutorials, obfuscation <br />
        often rules. Relax. This will be easy. <br />
        A global variable is one that's declared in the main body of your
        code—that is, not inside <br />
        a function. <br />
        A local variable is one that's declared inside a function. It can be
        either a parameter of <br />
        the function, which is declared implicitly by being named as a
        parameter, or a variable <br />
        declared explicitly in the function with the var keyword. <br />
        What makes a global variable global is that it is meaningful in every
        section of your code, <br />
        whether that code is in the main body or in any of the functions. Global
        scope is like globa <br />l fame. Wherever you go in the world, they've
        heard of Bill Clinton. <br />
        A local variable is one that's meaningful only within the function that
        declares it. Local <br />
        scope is like local fame. The mayor of Duluth is known within Duluth,
        but pretty much <br />
        unknown everywhere else. <br />
        So there are two differences between global and local variables—where
        they're <br />
        declared, and where they're known and can be used. <br />
        Before I show you the first example, I want you to set aside what you
        know about passing <br />
        values to a function through arguments, and passing a value back to the
        calling code by way of <br />
        the return statement. Pretend you don't know anything about these
        things. I'll come back to <br />
        them later. Here's an example. <br />
        First, in the main code, a variable declaration followed by a call to a
        function: <br />
        1 var theSum <br />
        2 addNumbers(); <br />
        Then the function: <br />
        1 function addNumbers() { <br />
        2 theSum = 2 + 2; <br />
        3 } <br />
        In the example, the variable theSum is declared in the main code. The
        function <br />
        addNumbers is called to assign it a value. Having been declared in the
        main code, the variable <br />
        has global scope, so this function or any other function can use it. So
        can anything in the main<br />
        code. The function assigns the sum of 2 + 2 to this global variable.
        Since the variable has <br />
        global scope, the assignment is meaningful in all sections of your code,
        both the main code and <br />
        in all functions. The variable now has the value 4 in the function
        addNumbers, in the main <br />
        code, and in any other functions that use it. It doesn't matter where I
        write... <br />
        alert(theSum); <br />
        Wherever I write it—in the main code, in the function addNumbers, or in
        any other <br />
        function, an alert will display the number 4. <br />
        But if I declare the variable not in the main code, but inside the
        function... <br />
        1 function addNumbers() { <br />
        2 var theSum = 2 + 2; <br />
        3 } <br />
        ...the variable has the value 4 only inside the function. Everywhere
        else, it's unknown. <br />
        Everywhere else, it has no value at all. Since the variable theSum is
        declared with the <br />
        keyword var inside the function, not in the main code, its scope is
        local. It is meaningful only <br />
        inside the function. In other functions and in the main code, it is
        unknown. If I write... <br />
        alert(theSum); <br />
        ...in the function, an alert displays the number 4, because the variable
        theSum is known <br />
        inside the function, where it was declared. But if I write the same
        alert statement anywhere <br />
        else—in the main code or in another function—the code breaks, because
        theSum is unknown <br />
        outside the function. <br />
        Note: I say that a variable has local scope when you declare it in a
        function. By <br />
        "declaring it in a function" I mean that you declare the variable
        explicitly with the keyword <br />
        var—as opposed to casually introducing it into the function without var.
        (The exception is if <br />
        you name it as a parameter, in which case it's declared implicitly as a
        local variable of the <br />
        function.) If you get sloppy and begin using a new variable in the body
        of a function without <br />
        explicitly declaring it in the function with the keyword var, it is
        global—even though you <br />
        haven't declared it anywhere in the main code. <br />
        Now, to illustrate a point, I'm going to do something you'd actually
        never want to do in <br />
        your code. I'm going to declare a variable both in the main code and in
        the function. <br />
        First, in the main code: <br />
        1 var theSum = 1000; <br />
        2 addNumbers(); <br />
        Then in the function: <br />
        1 function addNumbers() { <br />
        2 var theSum = 2 + 2; <br />
        3 } <br />
        By declaring the variable twice—once in the main code and again in the
        function—I've <br />
        created two different variables that share the same name. One theSum is
        global. The other <br />
        theSum is local. This is not something you would ever want to do—it sets
        you up for coding <br />
        mistakes and makes your code almost impossible to follow—but I did it to
        show the difference <br />
        between global and local scope. By declaring theSum once in the main
        code, and again in the <br />
        function, I've created (1) a global variable that's useable almost
        everywhere and (2) a local <br />
        variable of the same name that's useable only inside the function. Why
        do I say the global <br />
        variable is useable almost everywhere? Because it's no good inside the
        function. Inside the <br />
        function, the name theSum stands for a local variable, so the name can't
        refer to the global <br />
        variable. In this situation, coders say the global variable is in the
        shadow of the local <br />
        variable. Inside the function, it can't be seen. Inside the function,
        only the local variable of that <br />
        name can be seen. <br />
        The local variable theSum has a value of 4 inside the function, but
        theSum outside the <br />
        function has a value of 1000. <br />
        Now let's journey a little farther into Wonderland, Alice. <br />
        First, a statement in the main code: <br />
        1 var theSum = addNumbers(); <br />
        Then a function: <br />
        1 function addNumbers() { <br />
        2 var theSum = 2 + 2; <br />
        3 return theSum; <br />
        4 } <br />
        Again, this isn't something you'd actually code. I use the example only
        to demonstrate <br />
        principles. In this code, you still have two different variables—a
        global variable and a local <br />
        variable—that share the same name, theSum, but now, thanks to the return
        statement, the <br />
        value of the local variable is assigned to the global variable. Now both
        variables have the <br />
        same name and the same value, but they're still different variables.
        <br />
        Which brings us to a question you may be asking: <br />
        If a function can use a global variable, why do you have to pass a value
        from an argument <br />
        to a parameter? Why not just declare a global variable, then have the
        function use it? Well, you<br />
        can, but asking functions to work with global variables is asking them
        to eavesdrop on the <br />
        main code, and like human eavesdropping, it invites mischief in the form
        of confusion and <br />
        unintended consequences. There is no controversy among coders about
        this. It's always best to <br />
        pass values explicitly to functions through arguments. Global variables
        have no place in <br />
        functions. <br />
        The same logic applies to the the argument for using the return
        statement. You can <br />
        change the value of a global variable within a function. When you do,
        the value of it changes <br />
        everywhere, including in the main code. No return is needed. But it's
        better practice to usea <br />
        local variable within the function, then pass that value back explicitly
        through a return <br />
        statement. <br />
